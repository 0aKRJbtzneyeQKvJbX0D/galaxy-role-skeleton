This is a drop in replacement role skeleton used to create ansible roles with the ansible-galaxy command.

List of internal variables used by the role:

    fact_controller_home
    fact_controller_user

### Detailed usage guide

You can replace the default ansble-galaxy role skeleton or point to this one using the ansible-galaxy ROLE_SKELETON option.

#### To use as an alternative role skeleton

```shell
ansible-galaxy init --role-skeleton=ALTERNATIVE_ROLE_SKELETON_PATH ansible-role-myrole
```

#### To as a replacment for the default role skeleton that ships with Ansible

If you want to completely replace the default ansible role skeleton directory provided by ansible then you could deleted the default role skeleton directory and replace it with this one.

Here is an example using a miniconda created python environment called ansible with a pip installed version of ansible.

```shell
cd ~/miniconda2/envs/ansible/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible/galaxy/data/
mv default default.org
git clone git@github.com:cjsteel/galaxy-role-default.git default
```

## Developing this role skeleton

If you wnat to customize a lot of items in this role skeleton it might be a good idea to set things up like this:

```shell
cd ~/miniconda2/envs/ansible/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible/galaxy/data/
git clone git@github.com:cjsteel/galaxy-role-default.git default.new
```

copy a single file to edit to the original default directory. Add the extension `.j2`

```shell
cp defaults.new/README.md defaults/README.md.j2
nano defaults/README.md.j2 
```

Create a test role using ansible-galaxy:

```shell
ansible-galaxy init --force test -vvv
```

Ensure you are getting the output you want.

```shell
cat ~/projects/test/README.md
```

Once you are ready:
* commit all your changes
* move the original default dir
* clone your new default dir to replace the default directory.
