This is a drop in replacement role skeleton used to create ansible roles with the ansible-galaxy command.



List of internal variables used by the role:

    fact_controller_home
    fact_controller_user

### Detailed usage guide

You can replace the default ansble-galaxy role skeleton or point to this one using the ansible-galaxy ROLE_SKELETON option.

#### Use as an alternative role skeleto

```shell
ansible-galaxy init --role-skeleton=ALTERNATIVE_ROLE_SKELETON_PATH ansible-role-myrole
```

#### Replacing the defaults that come with Ansible

If you want to replace the default ansible role skeleton directory provided by an ansible installation you can deleted the default role skeleton and replace it with this one.

Here is an example using a miniconda created python environment called ansible with ansible installed using pip.

```shell
# delete the default ansible-galaxy role skeleton
rm -R ~/miniconda2/envs/ansible/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible/galaxy/data/default
# replace is with this one
cd ~/miniconda2/envs/ansible/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible/galaxy/data/
git clone git@github.com:cjsteel/ansible-galaxy-template.git
```
